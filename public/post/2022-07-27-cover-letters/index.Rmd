# Cover letters

The [WTF AITA talk](https://wtf-aita.com/talk/#/industry-cover-letters) highlighted the [stevetemplates](http://svmiller.com/stevetemplates/) package for creating an elegant cover letter that renders from R Markdown. 

Also mentioned was the notion of "cover accessories." An excellent example of this is Javier Orraca's [org-themed Shiny demo Shiny app](https://javierorraca.shinyapps.io/Bloomreach_Shiny_App/) that he submitted as part of his successful Bloomreach job application. The [GitHub readme](https://github.com/JavOrraca/bslib_demo_shiny) for his project describes how this was done with bslib and thematic.
