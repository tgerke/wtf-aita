# The talk

The initial release of WTF AITA content took place at [rstudioconf::(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) in the form of a talk. Slides for this talk can be found [here](https://wtf-aita.com/talk/), and a video of the talk will be posted when available. 

# Content and further development

WTF AITA content consists of tools (often R-centric, but other languages/technologies are certainly welcome!) that help ease the transition from academia to industry careers. Current content domains include resume building, cover letter writing, and portfolio creation. Generally speaking, career transitions in this space are a **huge** topic, so there are definitely other areas to consider. If you have suggestions, please post an Issue or Pull Request at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tgerke/wtf-aita/).
