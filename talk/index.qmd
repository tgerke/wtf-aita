## What the f\*ck?

. . .

Good question!

-   Commonly asked regarding careers in academia

## What the f\*ck?

![Figure from [Schillebeeckx et al., Nat Biotech (2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2706)](img/phds-vs-jobs.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A plot showing way more phds granted than faculty positions available each year"}

## What the f\*ck?

A common academic career question

-   This is not a talk about that
-   See instead: [quit lit](https://theprofessorisin.com/tag/quit-lit/)

. . .

Generalizes beyond academia

-   If you've asked yourself this question, this talk is for you!

## Am I the a$$hole?

. . .

Often happens when academics first apply to industry roles

:::{.incremental}

1.  Resumes that are too long
2.  Cover letters that look like research statements
3.  Unclear or absent coding portfolio

:::

. . .

Don't make others work to discover how awesome you are!

-   RStudio has tools to help you shine in each of the above
