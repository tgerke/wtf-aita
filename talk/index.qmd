## What the f\*ck?

. . .

Good question!

::: {.incremental}
  - Commonly asked regarding careers in academia
  - This is not a talk about that

Generalizes beyond academia

  - If you've asked yourself this question, this talk is for you!

## Am I the a$$hole?

. . .

Often happens when academics first apply to industry roles

::: {.incremental}
  1. Resumes that are too long
  2. Cover letters that look like research statements
