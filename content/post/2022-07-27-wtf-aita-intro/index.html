<h1>Content and further development</h1>
<p>WTF AITA content consists of tools (often R-centric, but other languages/technologies are certainly welcome!) that help ease the transition from academia to industry careers. Current content domains include resume building, cover letter writing, and portfolio creation. Generally speaking, career transitions in this space are a <strong>huge</strong> topic, so there are definitely other areas to consider. If you have suggestions, please post an Issue or Pull Request at the <a href="https://github.com/tgerke/wtf-aita/">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
