<h1>Cover letters</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://wtf-aita.com/talk/#/industry-cover-letters">WTF AITA talk</a> highlighted the <a href="http://svmiller.com/stevetemplates/">stevetemplates</a> package for creating an elegant cover letter that renders from R Markdown.</p>
<p>Also mentioned was the notion of “cover accessories.” An excellent example of this is Javier Orraca’s <a href="https://javierorraca.shinyapps.io/Bloomreach_Shiny_App/">org-themed Shiny demo Shiny app</a> that he submitted as part of his successful Bloomreach job application. The <a href="https://github.com/JavOrraca/bslib_demo_shiny">GitHub readme</a> for his project describes how this was done with bslib and thematic.</p>
